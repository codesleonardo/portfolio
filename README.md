## About the project

### Landing Page / Portfolio

[original design](https://www.figma.com/file/Ib1mgoazlFk5EA7aKEJbJZ/Landing-Page-Elise?node-id=0%3A1)

Of the prompts given: we chose to create a portfolio for Elise Bouer, a New Orleans Native, who studied web development with Practicum, and has recently been mentoring and freelancing. Bouer is also spiritual, eco-conscious, and passionate about animals.

It was decided that Bouer would create her own portfolio page to be rather modern and engaging, so we worked towards that styling when deciding how to design that page.

While the page was being created, some design ideas changed with how it was responding once coming to life, and changed into what is now deployed.

The Portfolio page is created with HTML, CSS, and just a little bit of JavaScript.

### MVP

[original design](https://www.figma.com/file/8p43vy1CxMFuDkDRrYPvDr/Guided-Mediation-App?node-id=0%3A1)

With the prompt, we were instructed to create an application that the same character had created. Our group was drawn to the "Guided Meditation App" suggestion that was with Bouer's character, and decided that would be the MVP to try making.

As Bouer is a professional developer, keeping the design simple and intuitive for use was a main goal. While being developed, changes to how the application looked compared to the design occurred.

The application is created in React.js, and utilizes the [React H5 Audio Player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-h5-audio-player) to handle audio controls for the different pre-set meditations, and otherwise has all custom designs and components.

This app also features a custom timer for self-guided meditations where a *gong* will sound randomly throughout the duration of the session, and a *bell* will sound at the beginning and end of the session.
